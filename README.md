* Dual-core 32-bit processor with adjustable clock frequency (80 MHz to 240 MHz)
* 4 MB of embedded flash memory
* Integrated 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities
* Multiple GPIOs for peripheral interfacing

These specifications make the ESP32-WROOM-32D suitable for handling complex signal processing tasks efficiently.

**Radio Frequency Modules**

The platform's design allows for configurable RF modules, enhancing its versatility:
**Left Switch - Top 3 radios**
**Right Switch - 2 Side radios**

* **Configuration A**: Five NRF24L01+PA+LNA modules
* **Configuration B**: Three NRF24L01+PA+LNA modules combined with two CC1101 modules
* **Configuration C?**: Five CC1101 modules

This modularity enables tailored configurations to meet specific operational requirements, facilitating tasks such as frequency scanning and signal generation.

**HackRF One Integration**

To extend the system's frequency range, Project Starbeam integrates with HackRF One, an open-source software-defined radio (SDR) peripheral capable of transmitting and receiving signals from 1 MHz to 6 GHz. It connects to a raspberry pi via the TX/RX pins at the bottom. This integration significantly broadens the platform's capabilities, allowing for comprehensive signal analysis across a wide spectrum.
